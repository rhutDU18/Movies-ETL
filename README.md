# Movies-ETL Summary

Extracting, transforming, and loading data is broken down into 3 steps. Extraction involves reading data from multiple sources which in our case came from both a Wikipedia JSON data set and movie and rating csv files from Kaggle. In order to create a pipeline to take in new data we had to create the correct file path and then proceed to transform our data by parsing and cleaning various functions. Finally we can load our cleaned dataset into SQL databases to display the correct amount of rows and columns in our two queries for both movie data and ratings data.
